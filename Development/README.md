# SciCat Data Catalogue Developer Guide

This section has been split in two sub sections related to the backend version.

On May 2023, the new backend V4.x based on nest.js has been officially released. We quickly realized that we needed two completely different sections to address the specific needs of each individual version.

Development documentation:

- [v3.x](v3.x/README.md) (based on loopback v3)
- [v4.x](v4.x/README.md) (based on nest.js)
