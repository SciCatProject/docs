# Overview and Concepts<a id="sec-1" name="sec-1"></a>

PSI offers a Data Catalog Service for annotated long-term data storage
, retrieval and publishing. The annotation information , i.e. metadata
is stored in a central database to allow for fast query for the
data. The raw data itself is stored on the PetaByte Archive at the
Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS).  The Data Catalog and
Archive is designed to be suitable for:

-   Raw data generated by PSI instruments or simulations
-   Derived data produced by processing the raw input data
-   Data required to reproduce PSI research and publications, e.g FAIR data

All data which are added to the data catalog must either not be
classified or have a classification level of "normal".
You are not allowed to add any personal or private data. You are not
allowed to use the data catalog as a backup system. Data must come
from scientific activities pursued at PSI. If data from external
partner institutes should be stored, then this needs a dedicated
contract signed by the management.

The service is based on the catalog system SciCat, documented at
<https://scicatproject.github.io/> and
<https://github.com/SciCatProject/>, which is an open source system that
allows to ingest and retrieve datasets in different ways, matching the
requirements of the respective use cases. The use cases differ in the
level of automation provided.

Data is always stored in terms of `datasets`, which you can think of as a
collection of files combined with administrativ and scientific metadata.

This manual describes how you can use this services by following the
main steps in the lifecycle of the data management:

-   Definition and ingestion of metadata
-   Archiving of the datasets
-   Retrieving of datasets
-   Publishing of datasets
-   Retention of datasets

Note: as of today (June 2021) the services can be only be used from
within the PSI intranet with the exception of the published data,
which is by definition publicly available. Although the service itself
can be used from any operating system, the command line and
GUI tools currently offered are available only for Linux and Windows
platforms.

# The Concept of Datasets<a id="sec-2" name="sec-2"></a>

For the following it is useful to have a better understanding of the
concept of a dataset.  A dataset is a logical grouping of potentially
many files. It is up to the scientist to define datasets from the
files. When defining datasets take the following conditions into
account

-   a dataset is the smallest unit for adding meta data
-   a dataset is the smallest unit for data handling (archiving and retrieval)
-   a dataset is the smallest unit for publication (DOI assignmnet)

Therefore you need to find a compromise between putting too few or too
many files into a single dataset. 

`Ingestion` of datasets means, that you make data known to the data
catalog by providing both metadata about the dataset and the file
listing comprising the dataset. For each dataset a persistent
identifier (PID) is automatically created.

It is important to note that the data catalog is a "passive" system in
the sense that it has to be told if new data arrives. The data catalog
has no direct access to the file systems containing the actual
files. In contrast the **datasetIngestor** program is run from systems, which
have access to the data files.

The datasets always belong to an so called ownerGroup. Only members of
these groups have access to the data, unless the dataset is being
published. At PSI there are two types of ownerGroups,

-   pgroups, starting with letter "p". They are used for experimental
    data linked to a proposal system. They are managed by the digital
    user office DUO
-   a-groups, starting with "a-" for any other data to be archived

Once data is contained in the data catalog, this information is
considered to be stored permanently. However after a retention period
the connected raw data files may actually be deleted. In this case the
dataset is **marked** as deleted in the data catalog, but the data
catalog entry persists, in agreement with the FAIR principles.

Warning: you should not modify the files which make up your dataset
after the dataset was ingested to the datacatalog. This means that you
should ingest the data only, if you are sure that no further
modifications on the files take place. The subsequent archive job will
only take care of the files which existed at ingest time and otherwise
return an error message and not archive the data at all.

# Getting started<a id="sec-3" name="sec-3"></a>

You will need a PSI account and this account needs to be member in so
called `p-groups`, which are managed by the PSI digital user office
proposal system and are usually linked to a principal investigator
(PI). This is required to define the authorization to the data,
i.e. who is allowed to see which datasets.

In addition to these so called `user accounts` there are a couple of
pre-defined `functional accounts` which are used for automated
processes. In particular each beamline has one such functional
account, e.g. called sls-tomcat, which can be used for automated
ingestion of new data or to query all data generated at a given
beamline. These accounts are only defined in the data catalog system
and are given to the respective beamline managers.

If your data can not be linked to this proposal system you can still
use the services, but you may need to ask for the creation of a
so-called `a-group` and become member in these groups. You can order
an `a-group` via ServiceNow under `PSI Service Catalog` -> `IT` ->
`Identity & Access Management` -> `Order Group / Project drive`. Under
`Account Type` choose `Archive Group / Project Drive`. You will be
asked about the group members. The group owner is not automatically
added to the group members.

To use some of the software you may need to install it
first. Installation is described in the appendix Installation of Tools

# Ingest<a id="sec-4" name="sec-4"></a>

## Important Update since April 14th 2022<a id="sec-4-1" name="sec-4-1"></a>

For all commandline tools, like the datasetIngestor, datasetRetriever
  etc, using your own user account you **have** to use the &#x2013;token
  option with a predefined API token SCICAT-TOKEN. Specifying
  username/password is not possible for normal users (this limitation
  is caused by the switch to a new authentication protocol). The
  easiest to get such an API token is to sign it at
  <https://discovery.psi.ch>, then follow the "Login with PSI account"
  button. This will bring you to the user settings page, from where
  you can copy the token with a click on the corresponding copy
  button. 

For functional accounts, like beamline accounts you can
however continue to use username/password authentication instead.

## Definition of input files<a id="sec-4-2" name="sec-4-2"></a>

First you need to specify the location of the files that you want to
have stored as one dataset. A typically example would be all the files
taken during a measurement, a scan etc or all output data from an
analysis of raw data files. In the simplest case it is sufficient to
define only one location. i.e. the **sourceFolder**, which should
contain all the files (and only those files) that make up the
dataset. In a more general case you can also specify an explicit list
of files and/or directories that you want to have assembled to a
dataset. See the datasetIngestor command options for details. The
appendix has a Recommended file structure for raw datasets on
disk. Please take note of the limitations of a dataset, as
defined in the appendix Dataset limitations.

## Definition of metadata<a id="sec-4-3" name="sec-4-3"></a>

There are two types of metadata which need to be provided:

-   administrative metadata: specifies when and where the data is taken,
    who is the owner etc. There are both mandatory and optional fields
    and the fields depend on the type of the dataset
    (generic/raw/derived), see Section 11.4
    below. The most important metadata field for ownership is the value
    of the "ownerGroup" field, which defines a group name, whose member
    have access to the data.
-   scientific metadata: this depends on the scientific discipline and
    can be defined in a flexible way by respective research group. It is
    up to the research groups to define the format(s) of their data that
    they want to support, ideally on an international level. See also
    the section About Scientific Values and Units .

Therefore the next step to ingesting your data into the catalog is to
prepare a file describing what data you have. This is called
metadata.json, and can be created with any text editor. It can in
principle be saved anywhere, but keeping it with your archived data is
recommended.

Here is a minimalistic example the file metadata.json for raw data:

    {
        "creationLocation": "/PSI/SLS/TOMCAT",
        "sourceFolder": "/data/p16/p16623/June2020",
        "type": "raw",
        "ownerGroup":"p16623"
    }

In the Appendix Use Case Examples you find many more examples for
metadata.json files, both for raw and derived data.  Here is a more
real life example from Bio department:

    {
        "principalInvestigator": "albrecht.gessler@psi.ch",
        "creationLocation": "/PSI/EMF/JEOL2200FS",
        "dataFormat": "TIFF+LZW Image Stack",
        "sourceFolder": "/gpfs/group/LBR/pXXX/myimages",
        "datasetName": "myimages",
        "owner": "Wilhelm Tell",
        "ownerEmail": "wilhelm.tell@psi.ch",
        "type": "raw",
        "description": "EM micrographs of amygdalin",
        "ownerGroup": "a-12345",
        "scientificMetadata": {
            "sample": {
                "name": "Amygdalin beta-glucosidase 1",
                "uniprot": "P29259",
                "species": "Apple"
            },
            "dataCollection": {
                "date": "2018-08-01"
            },
            "microscopeParameters": {
                "pixel size": {
                    "value": 0.885,
                    "unit": "A"
                },
                "voltage": {
                    "value": 200,
                    "unit": "kV"
                },
                "dosePerFrame": {
                    "value": 1.277,
                    "unit": "e/A2"
                }
            }
        }
    }

For manual creation of this file there are various helper tools
available. One option is to use the ScicatEditor
<https://bliven_s.gitpages.psi.ch/SciCatEditor/> for creating these
metadata files. This is a browser-based tool specifically for
ingesting PSI data. Using the tool avoids syntax errors and provides
templates for common data sets and options. The finished JSON file can
then be downloaded or copied into a text editor.

Another option for datasets on ra or merlin is to use the SciCat
graphical interface from NoMachine. This provides a graphical
interface for selecting data to archive. This is particularly useful
for data associated with a DUO experiment and p-group. Type `SciCat` to
get started after loading the datacatalog module. The GUI also
replaces the the command-line ingestion decribed below.

After preparing your metadata.json file, run the following steps to
ingest the data. First, perform a "dry-run" that will check the
metadata for errors: ( Please note that in the following only the
Linux type notation is used. For the changes which apply to Windows
see the separate section below)

    datasetIngestor metadata.json

It will ask for your PSI credentials and then print some info
about the data to be ingested. This command will scan the files, make
checks and extract further metadata information from the files and
from the DUO system, unless the corresponding metadata fields are
already provided in the metadata.json file. If there are no errors,
proceed to the real ingestion:

    datasetIngestor --ingest metadata.json

For particularly important datasets, you may also want to use the
parameter &#x2013;tapecopies 2 to store redundant copies of the data.
To give some numbers, 0.2–0.4% of the tapes get damaged so 
there is a chance that archiving with only one copy will result in lost 
data, in very few cases. Keep in mind that archival with redundancy 
doubles the cost which is billed to the responsible department.

You may be asked whether you want to copy the data first to a central
system. This step is needed for all files which are not residing on
one of the central fileservers at PSI. In particular local (windows)
workstations/PCs are likely to fall in this category.

There are more options for this command, just type

    datasetIngestor

to see a list of available options. In particular you can define
explicit list of files to be combined into a dataset, which can come
from many different folders by providing a filelisting.txt file
containing this information in addition to the metadata.json file. The
section in the Appendix Using the datasetIngestor Tool has more details

## Special notes for the decentral use case<a id="sec-4-4" name="sec-4-4"></a>

### For Windows<a id="sec-4-4-1" name="sec-4-4-1"></a>

For Windows you need execute the corresponding commands inside a
powershell and use the binary files ending in .exe, e.g.

    datasetIngestor.exe -token SCICAT-TOKEN -user username:password -copy metadata.json

For Windows systems you can only use personal accounts and the data is
always handled as `decentral` case, i.e. the data will first be copied
from the windows machine to a central file server via scp
first. Therefore you need to specify all of the above parameters
-token, -user and -copy. 

Please also note the syntax, that has to be used for the definition of
the sourceFolder inside the metadata.json file: this has to be in the
following form:

    "sourceFolder": "/C/Somefolder/etc",

, i.e. **forward slashes** and **no colon** ":" after the drive letter like
"C:" in this case.

### For Linux.<a id="sec-4-4-2" name="sec-4-4-2"></a>

You must have a valid kerberos ticket in order to be able to copy the
data to the intermediate storage server. You can use the kinit command
to get this ticket.

# Archive<a id="sec-5" name="sec-5"></a>

If there are no errors, your data has been accepted into the data
catalog! From now on, no changes should be made to the ingested
data. This is important, since the next step is for the system to copy
all the data to the CSCS Petabyte archive. Writing to tape is slow, so
this process may take some time, and it will fail if any
modifications are detected.

Triggering the copy to tape can be done in 3 ways. Either you do it
automatically as part of the ingestion

    datasetIngestor --ingest --autoarchive metadata.json

In this case directly after ingestion a job is created to copy the
data to tape.  Your dataset should now be in the queue. Check the data
catalog: <https://discovery.psi.ch>. Your job should have status
'WorkInProgress'. You will receive an email when the ingestion is
complete.

The second method is to use the discovery.psi.ch to interactively
start the archive job: click on the "Archivable" button. You should
see the newly ingested datasets. Select all the datasets you want to
have archived and click 'Archive'. You should see the status change
from 'datasetCreated' to 'scheduleArchiveJob'. This indicates that the
data is in the process of being transferred to CSCS. After some time
the dataset's status will change to 'datasetOnAchive' indicating the
data is stored.

A third option is to use a command line version datasetArchiver.

    datasetArchiver [options] (ownerGroup | space separated list of datasetIds) 
    
    You must choose either an ownerGroup, in which case all archivable datasets
    of this ownerGroup not yet archived will be archived.
    Or you choose a (list of) datasetIds, in which case all archivable datasets
    of this list not yet archived will be archived.
    
    List of options:
    
      -devenv
            Use development environment instead or production
      -localenv
            Use local environment (local) instead or production
      -noninteractive
            Defines if no questions will be asked, just do it - make sure you know what you are doing
      -tapecopies int
            Number of tapecopies to be used for archiving (default 1)
      -testenv
            Use test environment (qa) instead or production
      -token string
            Defines optional API token instead of username:password
      -user string
            Defines optional username and password

# Retrieve<a id="sec-6" name="sec-6"></a>

Here we describe the retrieval via the command line tools.  A retrieve
process via a desktop GUI application is described in the section SciCatArchiver GUI .

Retrieving is two-step process: first the data is copied from tape to a
central retrieve server. From there the data needs to be copied to the
final destination system of your choice.

## First Step<a id="sec-6-1" name="sec-6-1"></a>

For the first step: login to <https://discovery.psi.ch> , find the
datasets you want to retrieve and selected all "Retrievable" datasets
by clicking the corresponding button. Finally click the retrieve
button. This will create a retrieve job. Once it is finshed you will
get an email. Depending on the size of your datasets this may take

## Second Step (for Linux)<a id="sec-6-2" name="sec-6-2"></a>

### Standard commands<a id="sec-6-2-1" name="sec-6-2-1"></a>

For the second step you can use the **datasetRetriever** command, which
uses the rsync protocol to copy the data to your destination.

    Tool to retrieve datasets from the intermediate cache server of the tape archive
    to the destination path on your local system.
    Run script with 1 argument:
    
    datasetRetriever [options] local-destination-path
    
    Per default all available datasets on the retrieve server will be fetched.
    Use option -dataset or -ownerGroup to restrict the datasets which should be fetched.
    
      -chksum
            Switch on optional chksum verification step (default no checksum tests)
      -dataset string
            Defines single dataset to retrieve (default all available datasets)
      -devenv
            Use development environment (default is to use production system)
      -ownergroup string
            Defines to fetch only datasets of the specified ownerGroup (default is to fetch all available datasets)
      -retrieve
            Defines if this command is meant to actually copy data to the local system (default nothing is done)
      -testenv
            Use test environment (qa) (default is to use production system)
      -token string
            Defines optional API token instead of username:password
      -user string
            Defines optional username and password (default is to prompt for username and password)

For the program to check which data is available on the cache server
and if the catalog knows about these datasets, you can use:

    datasetRetriever my-local-destination-folder

If you want you can skip the previous step and
directly trigger the file copy by adding the -retrieve flag:

    datasetRetriever -retrieve <local destinationFolder>

This will copy the files into the destinationFolder using the original
sourceFolder path beneath the destinationFolder. This is especially
useful if you want to retrieve many datasets, which you expect to
appear in the same folder structure as originally. 
S
Optionally you can also verify the consistency of the copied data by
using the -chksum flag

    datasetRetriever -retrieve -chksum <local destinationFolder>

If you just want to retrieve a single dataset do the following:

    datasetRetriever -retrieve -dataset <datasetId> <local destinationFolder>

If you want to retrieve all datasets of a given **ownerGroup** do the following:

    datasetRetriever -retrieve -ownergroup <group> <local destinationFolder>

### Expert commands<a id="sec-6-2-2" name="sec-6-2-2"></a>

If you prefer to have more control over the file transfer you are free
to type your own rsync commands, e.g. to simply the folders available
in the retrieve cache do:

    rsync -e ssh --list-only pb-retrieve.psi.ch:retrieve/

To actually copy the data over use:

    rsync -e ssh -av pb-retrieve.psi.ch:retrieve/{shortDatasetId} your-destination-target/

In this case the shortDatsetId is the dataseid id without the PSI
prefix, e.g. for dataset PID
20.500.11935/08bc2944-e09e-48da-894d-0c5c47977553 the shortDatasetId
is 08bc2944-e09e-48da-894d-0c5c47977553

## Second Step (for Windows)<a id="sec-6-3" name="sec-6-3"></a>

The second step for Windows is instead using the sftp
protocol. Therefore any sftp client for Windows, like e.g. Filezilla,
can then be used to retrieve the data to your local Windows PC. The
following connection information must be provided, taking the command
line client access via powershell as an example

    # for the production system
    sftp -P 4222 your-username@pb-retrieve.psi.ch
    # or for the test system
    sftp -P 4222 your-username@pbt-retrieve.psi.ch

After the connection is built up you can copy files recursively,
e.g. using the "get -r \*" command. With the filezilla GUI you can
achieve the same via drag and drop operations

# Ingest, Archive and Retrieve with QT desktop application SciCat<a id="sec-7" name="sec-7"></a>

## Important Update since April 14th 2022:<a id="sec-7-1" name="sec-7-1"></a>

You currently first need to get a token before you can use SciCat: the
easiest to get such an API token is to sign it at
<https://discovery.psi.ch>, then follow the "Login with PSI account"
button. This will bring you to the user settings page, from where you
can copy the token with a click on the corresponding copy button.

## General considerations<a id="sec-7-2" name="sec-7-2"></a>

`SciCat` is a GUI based tool designed to make initial
ingests easy. It is especially useful, to ingest data, which can not
be ingested automatically. Therefore it is designed in particular to
assist you when archiving derived datasets. Often, the archival of
derived data cannot be scheduled in advance, nor does it follow a
strict file structure. The `SciCat` GUI can help you to ingest such
datasets more easily. Yet, the ingestion of raw datasets is also
supported.  Additionally, the tool also allows for the convenient
retrieval of datasets.

## Getting started<a id="sec-7-3" name="sec-7-3"></a>

Currently, `SciCat` is supported on PSI-hosted **Linux** and **Windows**
systems and is accessible on the Ra cluster as part of the datacatalog
module: just type

    module load datacatalog

Then the software can be started with

    SciCat

On the SLS beamline consoles the software is also pre-installed in the
/work/sls/bin folder, which is part of the standard PATH variable. 

If you are not working on the Ra cluster you can download the
software on Linux:

    /usr/bin/curl -O https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/raw/master/linux/SciCat;chmod +x ./SciCat

On Windows the executable can be downloaded from

    https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/-/blob/master/windows/SciCatGUI_Win10.zip

To start the GUI, unzip the directory and execute SciCat.exe

## Login and permissions<a id="sec-7-4" name="sec-7-4"></a>

After starting the GUI, you will be asked for a username and password. Please 
enter your PSI credentials. Functional accounts are not supported. 

## Pgroup selection<a id="sec-7-5" name="sec-7-5"></a>

The first step is always to select the pgroup. If there is no proposal assigned to 
this account, you will have to specify the information about the PI manually. 

![img](./screenshots/proposal_found.png "Pgroup selection")

## Archiving<a id="sec-7-6" name="sec-7-6"></a>

After selection the files, you will be prompted with a metadata editor, where you can modify 
the general info, such as dataset name, description etc. Please make 
sure that you select the correct data type (raw or derived). As a general rule of thumb, it is 
a derived dataset if you can specify a raw dataset as input. If you want to ingest a derived dataset, 
you can specify corresponding raw datasets on the "Input datasets" tab. 
To edit scientific metadata, switch to "Scientific metadata" tab. 

## Retrieval<a id="sec-7-7" name="sec-7-7"></a>

Retrieving successfully archived datasets from SciCat is a two-step process. First you will have to 
retrieve to an intermediate server. Once the data is there, you will be notified by email. 
The final step is to copy the data to the final destination on your machine. 
Both steps can be steered from within the GUI. 

On the retrieve page, all datasets of your pgroup are listed. If the data has been archived successfully, 
the cell in column "retrievable" is set to "true". To retrieve the data to the intermediate file server,
select the datasets that you want to retrieve and click on "Retrieve." After the retrieval, the column
"retrieved" is set to true. You are now able to start copying the data to you local machine by selecting
the desired datasets and clicking on "Save." 

## Settings<a id="sec-7-8" name="sec-7-8"></a>

Additional settings, such as the default value for certain fields can be modified in settings panel (button
on the lower left corner). 

# Publish<a id="sec-8" name="sec-8"></a>

As part of a publication workflow datasets must become citable via a
digital object identifier (DOI). This assignment is done as part of
the publication workflow described below. The publication then can
link to these published datasets using this DOI. The DOIs can link to
both raw and/or derived datasets. The published data and therefore the
DOI ususally refers to a **set** of Datasets, thus avoiding the need to
list potentially thousands of individual dataset identifiers in a
journal publication.

You publish data in the following way: go to <https://discovery.psi.ch> ,
login and select all the datasets, that you want to publish under a
new DOI. 

![img](./screenshots/PublishingData1.png "Selecting Datasets to be published")

Then you add these datasest a a "shopping cart" by using the "add to
Cart" button. You can repeat this often as needed. Once finished with
the selection you can "check out" the cart (click on the cart in the
top bar) and pick the "Publish" action.

![img](./screenshots/PublishingData2.png "Check out cart")

This opens a form
with prefilled information derived from the connected proposal
data. This data can then be edited by the user and finally saved.

![img](./screenshots/PublishingData3.png "Defining metadata of published data")

This defines the data as to be published and makes it known to the
data catalog, but the corresponding DOI is not yet made globally
available. For this last step to happen, someone with access to this
newly generated published data definition (e.g. the person defining
the published data or e.g. the PI) has to hit the "register"
button. This will trigger the global publication of the DOI. The links
on <https://doi.org> are usually updated within one day, so wait one day
before following these links or searching for the doi via the doi
reolver.

All published data definitions are then openly available via the so
called "Landing Pages", which are hosted on <https://doi.psi.ch> .

The file data itself data becomes available via the normal data export
System of the Ra cluster, which requires however a PSI account. If you
want to make the file data anonymously available you need to send a
corresponding request to stephan.egli@psi.ch for now. This process is
planned to be automated in future.

For now all publication are triggered by a scientist explicitly,
whenever necessary. In future in addition an automated publication
after the embargo period (default 3 years after data taking) will be
implemented (details to be defined)

# Troubleshooting<a id="sec-10" name="sec-10"></a>

## Locale error message<a id="sec-10-1" name="sec-10-1"></a>

If you get error messages like the following (so far only happened
from Mac Computers)

    perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
    perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
    ....

then you need to prevent that the Mac ssh client sends the
LC<sub>TYPE</sub> variable. Just follow the description in:
<https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/os-x-terminal-bash-warning-setlocale-lc_ctype-cannot-change-locale/>

## Invalid certificate messages<a id="sec-10-2" name="sec-10-2"></a>

The following message can be safely ignored:

    key_cert_check_authority: invalid certificate
    Certificate invalid: name is not a listed principal

It indicates that no kerberos token was provided for authentication.
You can avoid the warning by first running kinit (PSI linux systems).

## Long Running copy commands<a id="sec-10-3" name="sec-10-3"></a>

For decentral ingestion cases, the copy step is indicated by a message
'Running [/usr/bin/rsync -e ssh -avxz &#x2026;'. It is expected that this
step will take a long time and may appear to have hung. You can check
what files have been successfully transfered using rsync:

    rsync--list-only user_n@pb-archive.psi.ch:archive/UID/PATH/

where UID is the dataset ID (12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012) and
PATH is the absolute path to your data. Note that rsync creates
directories first and that the transfer order is not alphabetical in
some cases, but it should be possible to see whether any data has
transferred.

## Kerberos tickets<a id="sec-10-4" name="sec-10-4"></a>

As a normal user you should have a valid Kerberos ticket. This is
usually the case on the centrally provided Linux machines
automtically. You can verify the existence with the "klist"
command. In case no valid ticket is returned you have to get one using
the "kinit" command. (Note: beamline accounts do not need this)

    klist
    # if no Ticket listed get one by
    kinit

## Instructions to set ACLS in AFS<a id="sec-10-5" name="sec-10-5"></a>

In the AFS file system the user have to permit access to the
sourceFolder by setting read and lookup ACL permission for the AFS
group “pb-archive”. The easiest way to achieve is to run the following
script with the sourceFolder as an argunent

    /afs/psi.ch/service/bin/pb_setacl.sh sourceFolder

This script must be run by a person who has the rights to modify the
access rights in AFS.

## Installation of Tools<a id="sec-11-1" name="sec-11-1"></a>

### Access to the SciCat GUI<a id="sec-11-1-1" name="sec-11-1-1"></a>

For the access to the SciCat web-based user interface no software
needs to be installed, simply use your browser to go to
<https://discovery.psi.ch>. 

### Loading datacatalog tools on Clusters<a id="sec-11-1-2" name="sec-11-1-2"></a>

The latest datacatalog software is maintained in the PSI module system
on the main clusters (Ra, Merlin). To access it from PSI linux
systems, run the following command:

    module load datacatalog

### (Non-standard Linux systems) Installing datacatalog tools<a id="sec-11-1-3" name="sec-11-1-3"></a>

If you do not have access to PSI modules (for instance, when archiving
from Ubuntu systems), then you can install the datacatalog software
yourself. These tools require 64-bit linux.

I suggest storing the SciCat scripts in ~/bin so that they can be
easily accessed.

    mkdir -p ~/bin
    cd ~/bin
    /usr/bin/curl -O https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/raw/master/linux/datasetIngestor
    chmod +x ./datasetIngestor
    /usr/bin/curl -O https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/raw/master/linux/datasetRetriever
    chmod +x ./datasetRetriever
    /usr/bin/curl -O https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/raw/master/linux/SciCat
    chmod +x ./SciCat

When the scripts are updated you will be prompted to re-run some of
the above commands to get the latest version.

You can call the ingestion scripts using the full path
(~/bin/datasetIngestor) or else add ~/bin to your unix PATH. To do so,
add the following line to your ~/.bashrc file:

    export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"

### Installation on Windows Systems<a id="sec-11-1-4" name="sec-11-1-4"></a>

On Windows the executables can be downloaded from the following URL,
just enter the address in abrowser and download the file

    https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/-/blob/master/windows/datasetIngestor.exe
    https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/-/blob/master/windows/SciCatGUI_Win10.zip

### Online work stations in beamline hutches<a id="sec-11-1-5" name="sec-11-1-5"></a>

The command line tools are pre-installed in /work/sls/bin. No further
action needed

## Dataset limitations<a id="sec-11-2" name="sec-11-2"></a>

### Size limitations<a id="sec-11-2-1" name="sec-11-2-1"></a>

-   a single dataset should currently not have more than 400k files
-   a single dataset should not be larger than 50 TB
-   recommended size of a single dataset: between 1GB and 1TB

### SourceFolder and file names limitations<a id="sec-11-2-2" name="sec-11-2-2"></a>

The sourceFolder metadata and the name of the files can contain the following special characters: 
 - \%
 - \#
 - \-
 - \+
 - \.
 - \:
 - \=
 - \@
 - \_

Any other special characters are not guaranteed to work.

## Recommended file structure for raw datasets<a id="sec-11-3" name="sec-11-3"></a>

One recommended way of structuring your data on disk is the following:

    e12345   <--- user's group e-account, linked to a DUO proposal
    
      - sampleName  <-- contains measurement for a given sample
         - datasetfolder1   <-- name can be anything
           ... in here all the files, and only the files
           ... which make up a measurement
         - datasetfolder2   <-- name can be anything
           ... dito
         - etc...
         - derived-dataset1 (optional, for online processed data
                             name should contain "derived") 
           ... in here all the files and only the files
           ... which make up the derived data 
         - derived-dataset2
           ... dito
    
      - nextSampleName... 
    
    e12375    <--- next user's group e-account

## Metadata Field Definitions<a id="sec-11-4" name="sec-11-4"></a>

The following table defines the mandatory and optional fields for the
administrative metadata, which have to be provided (status June
2021). All fields marked "m" are mandatory, the rest is optional. Some
fields are filled automatically if possible, see comments. For the
most recent status see this URL
<https://scicatproject.github.io/api-documentation/> and follow the link
called "Model" for the respective datamodel (e.g. Dataset), visible
e.g. inside the GET API call section. Or see the model definitions as
defined in the SciCat backend, see the json files in
<https://github.com/SciCatProject/catamel/tree/develop/common/models>

All "Date" fields must follow the date/time format defined in RFC
3339, section 5.6, see <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt>

## About Scientific Values and Units<a id="sec-11-5" name="sec-11-5"></a>

It is strongly recommended that physical quantities are stored in the
 following format (the field names are just examples, the structure
 with the two fields "value" and "unit" is important here)

    "scientificMetadata": {
           ...
           "beamlineParameters": {
               "Ring current": {
                   "value": 402.246,
                   "unit": "mA"
               },
               "Beam energy": {
                   "value": 22595,
                   "unit": "eV"
               }
           }
           ....
    }

In future for such quantities the data catalog will automatically add
two additional fields "valueSI" and "unitSI" with the corresponding
SI units. The rationale for this is to support value queries in a
reliable manner across datasets with potentially different units
chosen for the same quantity:

    "scientificMetadata": {
           ...
           "beamlineParameters": {
               "Ring current": {
                   "value": 402.246,
                   "unit": "mA",
                   "valueSI": 0.402246,
                   "unitSI": "A"
               },
               "Beam energy": {
                   "value": 22595,
                   "unit": "eV",
                   "valueSI": 3.6201179E-15
                   "unitSI":"J"
               }
           }
           ....
    }

## Use Case Examples<a id="sec-11-6" name="sec-11-6"></a>

### Use Case: Manual ingest using datasetIngestor program<a id="sec-11-6-1" name="sec-11-6-1"></a>

1.  Overview

    Data owners may want to define in an adhoc manner the creation of
    datasets in order to allow a subsequent archiving of the data. The
    most important use cases are
    
    -   raw data from a beamline
    -   derived data created by a scientist
    -   archiving of historic data
    -   archiving of data stored on local (decentral) file storage systems
    
    For this purpose a command line client **datasetIngestor** is provided
    which allows to
    
    -   ingest the meta data and files
    -   optionally copy the data to a central cache file server
    
    The necessary steps to use this tool are now described:

2.  Preparation of the meta data

    You need to create a file metadata.json defining at least the
    administrative metadata

3.  Example of minimal json file for raw data:

        {
            "creationLocation": "/PSI/SLS/TOMCAT",
            "sourceFolder": "/scratch/devops",
            "type": "raw",
            "ownerGroup":"p16623"
        }

4.  Example for raw data including scientific metadata

        {
            "principalInvestigator": "egon.meier@psi.ch",
            "creationLocation": "/PSI/SLS/TOMCAT",
            "dataFormat": "Tomcat pre HDF5 format 2017",
            "sourceFolder": "/sls/X02DA/data/e12345/Data10/disk3/817b_B2_",
            "owner": "Egon Meier",
            "ownerEmail": "egon.meier@psi.ch",
            "type": "raw",
            "description": "Add  a short description here for this dataset ...",
            "ownerGroup": "p12345",
            "scientificMetadata": {
                "beamlineParameters": {
                    "Monostripe": "Ru/C",
                    "Ring current": {
                        "value": 0.402246,
                        "unit": "A"
                    },
                    "Beam energy": {
                        "value": 22595,
                        "unit": "eV"
                    }
                },
                "detectorParameters": {
                    "Objective": 20,
                    "Scintillator": "LAG 20um",
                    "Exposure time": {
                        "value": 0.4,
                        "unit": "s"
                    }
                },
                "scanParameters": {
                    "Number of projections": 1801,
                    "Rot Y min position": {
                        "value": 0,
                        "unit": "deg"
                    },
                    "Inner scan flag": 0,
                    "File Prefix": "817b_B2_",
                    "Sample In": {
                        "value": 0,
                        "unit": "m"
                    },
                    "Number of darks": 10,
                    "Rot Y max position": {
                        "value": 180,
                        "unit": "deg"
                    },
                    "Angular step": {
                        "value": 0.1,
                        "unit": "deg"
                    },
                    "Number of flats": 120,
                    "Sample Out": {
                        "value": -0.005,
                        "unit": "m"
                    },
                    "Flat frequency": 0,
                    "Number of inter-flats": 0
                }
            }
        }

5.  Example of minimal json file for derived data:

        { "sourceFolder" : "/data/test/myExampleData",
          "type" : "derived",
          "ownerGroup": "p12345",
          "investigator":"federika.marone@psi.ch",
          "inputDatasets": ["/data/test/input1.dat",
                            "20.500.11935/000031f3-0675-4d30-b5ca-b9c674bcf027"],
          "usedSoftware": ["https://gitlab.psi.ch/MyAnalysisRepo/tomcatScripts/commit/60629a1cbef493a26aac626602ba8f1a6c9e14d2"]
          }
    
    -   owner and contactEmail will be filled automatically
    -   important: in case you ingest derived datasets with a **beamline
        account** , such as slstomcat (instead of a personal account), you **have** to add the beamline account
        to the accessGroups field like this:
    
        { "sourceFolder" : "/data/test/myExampleData",
          "type" : "derived",
          "ownerGroup": "p12345",
          "accessGroups":["slstomcat"], 
          "investigator":"federika.marone@psi.ch",
          "inputDatasets": ["/data/test/input1.dat",
                            "20.500.11935/000031f3-0675-4d30-b5ca-b9c674bcf027"],
          "usedSoftware": ["https://gitlab.psi.ch/MyAnalysisRepo/tomcatScripts/commit/60629a1cbef493a26aac626602ba8f1a6c9e14d2"]
          }
    
    1.  Extended derived example
    
            {
                "sourceFolder": "/some/folder/containg/the/derived/data",
                "owner": "Thomas Meier",
                "ownerEmail": "thomas.meier@psi.ch",
                "contactEmail": "eugen.mueller@psi.ch",
                "type": "derived",
                "ownerGroup": "p13268",
                "creationTime": "2011-09-14T12:08:25.000Z",
                "investigator": "thomas.meier@psi.ch",
                "inputDatasets": [
                    "20.500.11935/000031f3-0675-4d30-b5ca-b9c674bcf027",
                    "20.500.11935/000031f3-0675-4d30-b5ca-b9c674bcf028"
                ],
                "usedSoftware": ["https://gitlab.psi.ch/MyAnalysisRepo/tomcatScripts/commit/60629a1cbef493a26aac626602ba8f1a6c9e14d2"]
            }

6.  Optionally: preparation of a file listing file

    **Please note**: The following is only needed, if you do not want to
    store all files in a source Folder, but just a **subset**. In this case
    you can specify an explicit list of files and directories. Only the
    files specified in this list will be stored as part of the
    dataset. For the directories in this list it is implied that they are
    recursively descended and all data contained in the directory is taken
    Here is an example for a filelisting.txt file. All entries in this
    textfiles are path names **relativ** to the sourceFolder specified in
    the metadata.json file
    
    Example of filelisting.txt
    
        datafile1
        datafile2
        specialStuff/logfile1.log
        allFilesInThisDirectory

7.  Optionally: for multiple datasets to be created

    If you have many sourceFolders containing data, each to be turned into
    a dataset then the easiest method is to define a 'folderlisting.txt'
    file.  (the file must have exactly this name). This is a useful option
    to archive large amounts of "historic" data.
    
    Each line in this file is the absolute path to the sourceFolder In
    this case it is assumed, that the metadata.json file is valid for all
    datasets and that **all** files inside the sourceFolder are part of the
    dataset (i.e. you can **not** combine the filelisting.txt option with the
    folderlisting.txt option)
    
    Example of folderlisting.txt
    
        /some/folder/containg/the/data/raw/sample1
        /some/folder/containg/the/data/raw/sample2
        /some/folder/containg/the/data/derived

8.  Starting the ingest

    Just run the following command in a terminal as a first test if
    everything is okay. This is a so called "dry run" and nothing will
    actually be stored, but the consistency of the data will be checked
    and the folders will be scanned for files
    
        datasetIngestor metadata.json [filelisting.txt | 'folderlisting.txt']
    
    You will be prompted for your username and password.
    
    If everything looks as expected you should now repeat the command with
    the "&#x2013;ingest" flag to actually store the dataset(s) in the data
    catalog
    
        datasetIngestor --ingest metadata.json [filelisting.txt | 'folderlisting.txt']
    
    When the job is finshed all needed metadata will be ingested into the
    data catalog (and for decentral data the data will be copied to the
    central cache file server).
    
    In addition you have the option to directly trigger the archiving of
    the data to tape by adding the &#x2013;autoarchive flag. Do this only if you
    sure that this data is worth to be archived

### Use Case: Automated ingest of raw datasets from beamline or instruments<a id="sec-11-6-2" name="sec-11-6-2"></a>

1.  Using the datasetIngestor Tool

    This method usually requires a fully automatic ingestion procedure,
    since data is produced at regular times and in a predictable way.
    
    For each beamline this automation is done together with the experts
    from the data catalog group and potentially with the help from the
    controls /detector-integration groups. Please contact
    scicatarchivemanager@psi.ch to get in touch.
    
    The recommended method is to define preparation scripts, which
    automatically produce the files metadata.json and optionally
    filelisting.txt or folderlisting.txt (for multiple datasets) as you
    would do in the manual case described in the previous section.
    Example of such scripts can be provided by the data catalog team,
    please contact scicatingestor@psi.ch for further help. The effort to
    implement such a system depends very much on the availability of the
    meta data as well as on the effort to convert the existing metadata to
    the data catalog format inside the converter processes. If the meta
    data is already available in some form in a file an estimate of the
    order of magnitude of work needed per instrument is 1-2 person-weeks
    of work, including test runs etc. But efforts may also be considerably
    smaller or larger in some cases.
    
    Then you run the datasetIngestor program usually under a beamline
    specic account. In order to run fully automatic all potential
    questions asked interactively by the program must be pre-answered
    through a set of command line options:
    
        datasetIngestor [options] metadata-file [filelisting-file|'folderlisting.txt']
        
          -allowexistingsource
                Defines if existing sourceFolders can be reused
          -autoarchive
                Option to create archive job automatically after ingestion
          -copy
                Defines if files should be copied from your local system to a central server before ingest.
          -devenv
                Use development environment instead of production environment (developers only)
          -ingest
                Defines if this command is meant to actually ingest data
          -linkfiles string
                Define what to do with symbolic links: (keep|delete|keepInternalOnly) (default "keepInternalOnly")
          -noninteractive
                If set no questions will be asked and the default settings for all undefined flags will be assumed
          -tapecopies int
                Number of tapecopies to be used for archiving (default 1)
          -testenv
                Use test environment (qa) instead of production environment
          -user string
                Defines optional username:password string
    
    -   here is a typical example using the MX beamline at SLS as an example
        and ingesting a singel dataset with meta data defined in
        metadata.json
    
        datasetIngestor -ingest \
          -linkfiles keepInternalOnly \
          -allowexistingsource \
          -user slsmx:XXXXXXXX \
          -noninteractive \
           metadata.json
    
    This command must be called by the respective data acquisition systems
    at a proper time, i.e. after all the files from the measurement run
    have been written to disk and all metadata became available (often
    this meta data is collected by the controls system). 

2.  HDF5 Files

    If the raw data exists in form of HDF5 files, there is a good chance
    that the meta data can be extracted from the HDF5 files' meta data. In
    such a case the meta data extraction must be done as part of the part
    beamline preparation scripts. Example of such HDF5 extraction scripts
    exist which can the basis of a beamline specific solution, again
    please contact scicatingestor@psi.ch. These scripts will mostly need
    minimal adjustments for each beamline, mainly specifying the filter
    conditions defining which of the meta data in the HDF5 file are to be
    considered meta data for the data catalog.
    
    Very often the whole dataset will only consist of one HDF5 file, thus
    also simplifying the filelisting definition.

### Use Case: Ingest datasets stored on decentral systems<a id="sec-11-6-3" name="sec-11-6-3"></a>

These are data that you want to have archived for some reason, but are
not available on central file systems. Data from the old PSI archiv
system fall in this category or data from local PCs, Laptops or
instruments. If this data is not assigned to a p-group (given via the
DUO digital user office, usually linked to a proposal) then you must
assign this data to an a-group. The allocation of an "a-group" for
this kind of data must be done beforehand by a tool currently in
preparation at AIT. The "a-group" will define the ownership and
therefor the access to the data by listing a number of users onside the
group.

Otherwise just follow the description in the section "Manual ingest
using datasetIngestor program" and use the option -copy, e.g.

    datasetIngestor -autoarchive -copy -ingest metadata.json

This command will copy the data to a central rsync server, from where
the archive system can then copy the files to tape, in this case
(option -autoarchive) the copy to archive tapes will happen automatically

On recent versions of the datasetIngestor program the program detects
automatically,if your data lies on central or decentral systems. In
the latter case it will, after a confirmation by the user, copy the
data automatically to the rsync cache server, even if the copy flag is
not provided.

### Use Case: Ingest datasets from simulations/model calculations<a id="sec-11-6-4" name="sec-11-6-4"></a>

These can be treated like datasets of type "base" or "raw". In the
latter case specify the field "creationLocation" as the name of the
server or cluster which produced the simulation files. Otherwise the
procedure is identical to the previous use case.

## Policy settings and email notifications<a id="sec-11-7" name="sec-11-7"></a>

The archiving process can further be configured via **policy**
parameters, e.g. if you require a second tape copy for very
precious data. Also the details about the notification settings by
email for both archive and retrieve jobs can be set here. You reach
the menu to set the policy values via the submenu `Policies`
in the dropdown menu to the top right of the GUI.

Emails are automatically sent at the start of every archive and
retrieve jobs as well as when the job finishes. The email is sent to
the person creating the jobs. In addition it is sent the list of
emails defined in the policy settings. Per default this list is empty
but can be extended by you. In the policy one can also switch off the
email notification. However emails about error conditions (which can
be either user caused or system caused) can not be switched off. Such
error messages are always sent to the user as well as the archive
administrators.

For user caused errors the user has to take action to repair the
situation. Typically error cases are, that the user has moved or
removed part or all of the files before archiving them. System errors
on the other hand have their reason inside the catalog and archive
system (e.g. a network connection problem or similar) and will be
taken care of by the archive managers. In such a case the user
creating the job will be informed manually, when the problem is fixed
again.

Policy parameters can be defined at site level or at ownerGroup
level. For each ownerGroup at least one manager must be defined
(e.g. a principal investigator (PI) via the linked proposal
information) in the policy model (field "manager") . Only the manager
can change the policy settings at ownerGroup level, but all group
mebers can see them.

Changes to this policy settings only effect future dataset creation
and archiving

## Analyzing Metadata Statistics<a id="sec-11-8" name="sec-11-8"></a>

Note: This service is currently (summer 2021) out of order due to the
missing JupyterHub environment.

### Overview<a id="sec-11-8-1" name="sec-11-8-1"></a>

It is possible to analyze the information about datasets amd jobs etc,
e.g. for statistical purposes. A Jupyterhub based solution was chosen
as a tool for allowing to do this analysis in a flexible and
interactive manner. This means you can use Jupyter notebooks to query
the Data catalog via the API for its data and analyze the results in
terms of tables and graphs. Example notebooks are provided.

### Getting started<a id="sec-11-8-2" name="sec-11-8-2"></a>

Simply follow the following link and login with your PSI account:
<https://jupyterhub.apps.ocp4a.psi.ch/> .  The initial start of the
Jupyter environments takes some time (about 40 seconds), but
subsequent starts are much faster. You will then see a "bootstrap"
notebook which you can execute to populate your Jupyter home directory
with the example notebooks. 

The example notebooks require you to login to the data catalog API
server. Here you can again use your personal account, which gives you
access to all data, for which you have read access (i.e. for which you
are member of the associated p-group). Beamline managers can also use
the beamline accounts here in order to get the statistics relevant for
the whole beamline. You can then look at the example notebooks,
e.g. datasetAnalyzer.ipynb and run it, look at resulting tables and
graphs. Afterwards you can optionally adapt the notebooks to your
needs.

Please note, that this service is currently only available as a pilot
with **no guaranteed availability**. This also means, that you should
make **regular backups of your own notebooks** which you may develop
using this tool. For this you can e.g. simply download the notebook
and copy it to a place for which backup exists, like your home
directory.

## Access to the API (for script developers)<a id="sec-11-9" name="sec-11-9"></a>

The data catalog can also be accessed directly via a REST API. There
exists an API "Explorer" which allows to test such API calls
conveniently. The explorer can be found at
<https://dacat-qa.psi.ch/explorer> .The explorer works with a test
database which is separate from the production database and contains
other data.

For most of the API calls you will need an access token first. You
create such an access token by "login" to the data catalog via the
following curl command:

    # for "functional" accounts
    curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{"username":"YOUR-LOGIN","password":"YOUR-PASSWORD"}' 'https://dacat-qa.psi.ch/api/v3/Users/login'
    
    # for normal user accounts
    curl -X POST --header 'Content-Type: application/json'  -d '{"username":"YOUR-LOGIN","password":"YOUR-PASSWORD"}' 'https://dacat-qa.psi.ch/auth/msad'
    
    # reply if succesful:
    {"id":"NQhe3...","ttl":1209600,"created":"2019-01-22T07:03:21.422Z","userId":"5a745bde4d12b30008020843"}

The "id" field contains the access token, which you copy in to the corresponding field at the top of the explorer page.

Afterwards you can test the full API. If you found the right API call
you can finally apply the call to the production system by replacing
"dacat-qa" by "dacat" and then by retrieving the access token from the
production system.

## Using datasetIngestor inside wrapper scripts (for developers)<a id="sec-11-10" name="sec-11-10"></a>

The command datasetIngestor returns with a return code equal zero in
case the command could be executed succesfully. If the program however
fails for some reason the return code will be one. Typical examples of
failures are that files can not be found or not be accessed. Other
possibilities are that the catalog system is not available,
e.g. during scheduled maintenance periods. All outputs describing the
reason for the failure are written to STDERR. Please have a look at
these outputs to understand what the reason for the failure was. If
you need help please contact scicatingestor@psi.ch

Please note: it is the task of the wrapper scripts to test
for the return code and to repeat the command once all conditions for
a succesful execution are fulfilled

In case the ingest finishes succesfully the dataset persistent
identifiers (PID) of the resulting dataset(s) are written to STDOUT,
one line per dataset.

## Ingestion of datasets which should never be published<a id="sec-11-11" name="sec-11-11"></a>

For datasets which should never be published you should add the
following fields at ingest time to your metadata.json file:

    "datasetlifecycle": {
        "publishable":false,
        "dateOfPublishing":"2099-12-31T00:00:00.000Z",
        "archiveRetentionTime":"2099-12-31T00:00:00.000Z"
    }

-   this will move the time of publication to a date in some far future
    (2100 in this case)

## Retrieving proposal information<a id="sec-11-12" name="sec-11-12"></a>

In case you need information about the principal investigator you can
use the command datasetGetProposal, which returns the proposal
information for a given ownerGroup

    /usr/bin/curl -O https://gitlab.psi.ch/scicat/tools/raw/master/linux/datasetGetProposal;chmod +x ./datasetGetProposal

## Link to Group specific descriptions<a id="sec-11-13" name="sec-11-13"></a>

-   BIO department: <https://intranet.psi.ch/BIO/ComputingDataCatalog>

## List of known creationLocation for raw data<a id="sec-11-14" name="sec-11-14"></a>

The following values for the creationLocation should be used for the
respective beamlines. They are derived from the identifiers used
inside the digital user office DUO
